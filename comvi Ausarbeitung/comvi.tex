The goal of this paper is to show the reader the abstract methods and concrete applications that were used to extract and compare features  and rank the similarity of the molecular protein maps.

\subsection{Initial Challenges and encountered problems}

It is clear that the task required from us that we learn how to compare the images, measure the distances between the images, and cluster these images.
The given task required that 

We could chose to find similarities and cluster the proteins in the \verb|.pdb| format or given as bitmap image generated by \todo{cite megamol protein image}



\subsection{Approaches to the Clustering-Problem}

Right of the start we had several ideas of how we could approach this problem. 
With the recent trend in machine learning we had a couple of ideas of how we could determine a similarity metric between two images or classify an image into a more usable vector of data.

We ended up using a higher dimensional feature vector ... to determine the similarirty between two protein maps because we didnt manage to train a custom model in the given timeframe, due to .

But our initial results with a pretrained Imagenet \todo{cite imagenet} \todo{cite darknet publication} model let us to believe that it shoud be definetly possible for this specified task to find a machine learning solution. 

\subsection{Approaches to the Visualization-Task}

Our aproaches to visualizing the given clusters were the following, the reader is reminded that we are not just visualizing the clusters on a ''normal machine'' but rather the POWERWALL, a projected display with effectively 6-24 times the resolution of a consumer grade display. Details on the POWERWALL can be found \todo{cite powerwall publicatoin here if available}.
