abstract = {With the development of magnetic resonance imaging techniques for acquiring diffusion tensor data frombiological tissue, visualiza- tion of tensor data has become a new research focus. The diffusion tensor describes the directional dependence of water molecules� diffusion and can be represented by a three-by-three symmetric matrix. Visualization of second-order tensor fields is difficult be- cause the data values have many degrees of freedom. Existing vi- sualization techniques are best at portraying the tensor�s proper- ties over a two-dimensional field, or over a small subset of loca- tions within a three-dimensional field. A means of visualizing the global structure in measured diffusion tensor data is needed. We propose the use of direct volume rendering, with novel approaches for the tensors� coloring, lighting, and opacity assignment. Hue- balls use a two-dimensional colormap on the unit sphere to illus- trate the tensor�s action as a linear operator. Lit-tensors provide a lighting model for tensors which includes as special cases both lit-lines (from streamline vector visualization) and standard Phong surface lighting. Together with an opacity assignment based on a novel two-dimensional barycentric space of anisotropy, thesemeth- ods are shown to produce informative renderings of measured dif- fusion tensor data from the human brain.},
